# Kharazmi-Game  
**An Educational Math Game for Middle School Students (Grade 7)**  
*Designed & Conceptualized by Sana Haghighi — Product Designer & UX Researcher*

---

## 🎯 Overview  
**Kharazmi-Game** is a creative math game that introduces algebraic logic to 13‑year‑old students (Grade 7) through colorful, story‑driven stages.  
Each level transforms abstract math concepts into interactive experiences, blending imagination with structured learning.  
Developed for both **desktop and tablet platforms**, the game is accessible to a wide range of learners.

---

## 🌱 Educational Context  
Rooted in research on **gamified learning and cognitive UX**, this project teaches algebra through motion‑guided scenes rather than static equations.  
The game helps learners connect visual perception and logical reasoning, building sustained focus and concept mastery.

## 🎮 Gameplay Structure  

| Stage | Title & Description | Learning Goal |
|-------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Stage 1 — Dream Kite Flight** | Fly your magical kite through the sky to collect *similar algebraic expressions*. The more matching terms you catch, the longer and brighter your kite tail grows—and you earn extra time for upcoming challenges! | Identify and group algebraic expressions by visual and logical similarity, building pattern recognition and speed. |
| **Stage 2 — The Balance of Equations** | Step into the world of equilibrium. Solve algebraic equations represented as a **scale**; every correct answer balances the plates and earns time bonuses and “Kharazmi badges.” | Understand equality and algebraic balance through dynamic visual feedback and precise logical analysis. |
| **Stage 3 — Rain of Algebraic Expressions** | The algebra sky opens! Raindrops of expressions fall—you must collect and arrange them correctly to build complete and valid formulas. Each successful expression earns a *Kharazmi badge*. | Practice constructing algebraic expressions under time constraint, strengthening conceptual synthesis and rapid decision‑making. |
| **Stage 4 — Maze of Visual Challenges** | Final level! Navigate through a **visual puzzle maze** full of geometric or numeric riddles. Here you solve problems like finding areas or identifying angles—no equations, only intuition and focus. | Apply mathematical reasoning visually; integrate learned logic and enhance spatial‑visual math understanding. |

## 🧩 Design Role  
As **Product Designer** and **UX Architect**, Sana guided the entire experience from learning model to visual flow:
- **Stage Logic Design:** Defined structure and pacing based on cognitive development of Grade 7 learners.  
- **UX Architecture:** Applied **MAPE framework** (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute) to create adaptive feedback and challenge progression.  
- **Visual & Interaction System:** Crafted minimal, student‑friendly interface with reward cues and real‑time motion elements.  
- **Learning Psychology:** Balanced performance pressure and enjoyment to maintain continuous educational motivation.  

Focus points: **educational gamification**, **conceptual learning**, and **experiential clarity**, not code development.

## 🔧 Technical Highlights  
**Engine:** Unity (runtime build for desktop + web)  
**Languages:** C#, ShaderLab, HLSL *(used by development collaborators for visual engine)*  
**Framework:** MAPE‑based adaptive interaction model built on Unity APIs  
**UI/UX Principles:** Progressive feedback · child‑oriented contrast · time‑based rewards  
**Version:** Final Educational Release  

> Implementation followed design specifications and pedagogical parameters defined by Sana Haghighi.

## 📚 Academic Integration  
The game was tested among **Grade 7 students** in Tehran (academic year 1403 – 1404)  
to evaluate engagement and learning impact. Results revealed significant improvement in algebra comprehension and motivation through visual‑experiential gamification.
