# Kharazmi-Game  
**An Educational Math Game for Middle School Students (Grade 8)**  
*Designed & Conceptualized by Sana Haghighi — Product Designer & UX Researcher*

---

## 🎯 Overview  
**Kharazmi-Game** is an interactive learning experience aimed at helping middle-school students (Grade 8) master algebraic concepts through play-based engagement.  
Built under an academic research framework, the game transforms *abstract mathematical relations* into *visual balance puzzles*, driving intuitive understanding through motion, challenge, and reward flow.

---

## 🌱 Educational Context  
This project was originally developed as part of an academic research initiative focused on **learning design** and **gamified education**.  
Its pedagogical structure targets the problem-solving skills of 13–14‑year‑old learners, balancing visual interactivity with mathematical reasoning.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Structure  
The game progresses across **four distinct stages**, each designed and prototyped to challenge students from different cognitive angles:

| Stage | Focus Area | Learning Goal |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Stage 1 — The Scale** | Visual Equilibrium | Comprehend equality and balance through motion-based puzzles |
| **Stage 2 — The Rain** | Pattern Recognition | Strengthen arithmetic simplification and logical grouping |
| **Stage 3 — The Model** | Algebraic Construction | Form and test algebraic equations intuitively |
| **Stage 4 — The Advanced Challenge** | Applied Problem Solving | Integrate learned algebraic skills under time and adaptive difficulty |

Each stage was carefully adapted to the learning level of **Grade 8 students**, ensuring that difficulty progression matches the academic curriculum and cognitive load required.

## 🧩 Design Role  
As the **Product Designer** and **UX Architect**, Sana directed:
- **Stage Design Logic:** Constructed full gameplay flow according to learner psychology and engagement feedback.  
- **Interaction Modeling:** Developed the rhythm of challenge/reward using the MAPE framework (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute).  
- **UI/UX Design:** Created visual hierarchy, feedback sequence, and minimalistic interface for clarity and focus.  
- **Human–Computer Interaction:** Defined adaptive responses and real-time loops tailored for educational reinforcement.  

Focus was placed on **conceptual balance between aesthetic simplicity and cognitive challenge**, not source coding.

## 🔧 Technical Highlights  
**Engine:** Unity (using minor C#/ShaderLab elements for procedural visuals)  
**Languages:** C#, ShaderLab, HLSL *(implemented by collaborators for graphics)*  
**Framework:** Custom interaction logic built on Unity API  
**Design Architecture:** MAPE-based adaptive user interaction model  
**UI/UX Principles:** Minimalist, child-centric design; clear progression feedback  
**Version:** Final Educational Release  

> Note: Technical implementation supported the product design and was co-engineered by development collaborators.

## 📚 Academic Integration  
The game was implemented and evaluated among Grade 8 students in Tehran (academic year 1403‑1404)  
to assess usability, engagement, and learning performance improvement.  
Results confirmed that **well-designed gamified experiences** significantly enhance algebraic understanding and motivation.

## 🚀 Future Directions  
- Integration with dynamic AI tutors for personalized difficulty scaling  
- Extending the design pattern to Geometry and Fraction modules  
- Cross‑platform adaptation for classroom simulation environments
