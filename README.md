# Kharazmi-Game

An educational web-based game designed to teach mathematical concepts — specifically algebraic equations — to middle school students through game-based learning and gamification.  
Developed as part of a Bachelor's project at Shahid Beheshti University, this project integrates interactive design, flow-based gameplay, and adaptive difficulty to enhance engagement and learning outcomes.

## 🎯 Project Overview
**Kharazmi-Game** transforms traditional math exercises into immersive game experiences.  
Students progress through structured levels where each mathematical challenge corresponds to conceptual complexity and visual feedback.  
The game employs cloud-based score tracking, time management logic, and visual dynamics to maintain attention and motivation.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Web-based platform, accessible via browser  
- Adaptive difficulty mechanism (auto-adjusts based on player performance)  
- No “back” navigation during gameplay to preserve challenge integrity  
- Separate modules for logic, UI, and back-end data flow  
- Designed for usability and motivation in STEM learning environments  

---

## 🧠 Technical Highlights
- **Language:** Python / JavaScript (depending on build mode)
- **Frameworks:** HTML5, CSS3, and a logic engine supporting real-time calculations  
- **Design Architecture:** MAPE-based adaptive model (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute)  
- **UI/UX Principles:** Simple, clear visual hierarchy; gamified interaction flow; child-friendly assets  
- **Version:** Initial Clean Release (no prior commits or contributors)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone & Setup
git clone https://github.com/SanaHaghighi/Kharazmi-Game.git
cd Kharazmi-Game

If you are starting from a clean local directory (no previous .git history), initialize git again:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial clean release"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/SanaHaghighi/Kharazmi-Game.git


### Push to GitHub
Now push your project to your repository:
git push -u origin main

> 💡 **Tip:** When prompted for authentication, paste your **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead of your password.  
> You can safely paste it using **Shift + Insert** (Windows).  
> PAT is stored locally by Git Credential Manager unless manually disabled.

## 🧩 Future Work & Expansion
- Integration with educational metrics (tests/pre-tests, scoring analytics)  
- Multiplayer or classroom dashboard  
- Adaptive progression engine based on student performance history  
- Visual polish with React/WebGL for dynamic interaction
