# Kharazmi-Game

An educational web-based game designed to teach mathematical concepts — specifically algebraic equations — to middle school students through game-based learning and gamification.  
Developed as part of a Bachelor's project at Shahid Beheshti University, this project integrates interactive design, flow-based gameplay, and adaptive difficulty to enhance engagement and learning outcomes.

## 🎯 Project Overview
**Kharazmi-Game** transforms traditional math exercises into immersive game experiences.  
Students progress through structured levels where each mathematical challenge corresponds to conceptual complexity and visual feedback.  
The game employs cloud-based score tracking, time management logic, and visual dynamics to maintain attention and motivation.

## 🧩 Features
- Web-based platform, accessible via browser  
- Adaptive difficulty mechanism (auto-adjusts based on player performance)  
- No “back” navigation during gameplay to preserve challenge integrity  
- Separate modules for logic, UI, and back-end data flow  
- Designed for usability and motivation in STEM learning environments

## 🧠 Technical Highlights
- **Language:** Python / JavaScript (depending on build mode)
- **Frameworks:** HTML5, CSS3, and a logic engine supporting real-time calculations  
- **Design Architecture:** MAPE-based adaptive model (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute)  
- **UI/UX Principles:** Simple, clear visual hierarchy; gamified interaction flow; child-friendly assets  
- **Version:** Initial Clean Release (no prior commits or contributors)
